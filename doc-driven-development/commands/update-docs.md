Update any relevant documentation to accurately reflect the current code changes (`git diff`)
and fill in any missing information. Some guidelines:

- Be concise. AI tends to generate very verbose/wordy documentation. Don't do that.
- Don't add trivial examples that users can easily figure out.
- Avoid duplicated information when possible.

Update `CLAUDE.md` with any architectural or technical details.

Also, update the `CHANGELOG.md` to describe changes as benefits to the user. It should not
include technical details of the change - that is what `git log` is for.
