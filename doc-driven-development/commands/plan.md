Create a plan file named `plans/<current date>-"$ARGUMENTS".md`. Replace spaces
with '-' in the filename.

Then switch to plan mode and create a plan for coding the current changes and untracked files (start
with `git diff` and `git status`) described in the README.md and other documentation files. Note,
in this phase, we are using documentation to drive the code, not the other way
around. When the plan is complete, write it to the plan file.
