Implement code changes for features described in the documentation (`*.md`) and
`plans/` directory changes - see changes with `git diff`.

Note for this command, the documentation is driving the code changes, not the
other way around.

After the plan is updated, update the original plan with any changes and change
the status in the plan file to `Implemented`. Do not created an additional plan
implemented file.
