# Claude Code Plugins

A collection of Claude Code plugins I use to enhance development workflows.

## Available Plugins

### Doc-Driven Development

A documentation-driven development plugin that helps you plan and implement code
changes based on markdown documentation.

[View Plugin Documentation](./doc-driven-development/README.md)

## Installation

### From GitHub (Recommended)

1. Add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add cbrake/claude-plugins
```

2. Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install doc-driven-development@cbrake
```

### Local Development

For local plugin development and testing, create a local marketplace:

```bash
# Add local marketplace
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-plugins

# Install from local marketplace
/plugin install doc-driven-development@cbrake
```

## Updating

To get the latest:

```bash
/plugin marketplace update cbrake
```

This appears to update all the plugins from this marketplace.

## Plugin Development

This repository follows the standard Claude Code plugin structure:

```
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin metadata
└── commands/
    └── command-name.md      # Command definitions
```

### Key Concepts

1. **Command definitions are markdown files** - Each `.md` file in `commands/`
   becomes a slash command
2. **Commands are prompts** - The markdown content is given to Claude Code when
   invoked
3. **Plugin metadata** - The `plugin.json` defines the plugin's identity

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidance.

## Contributing
